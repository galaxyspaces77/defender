sudo dnf -y install dnf-plugins-core
sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/rhel/docker-ce.repo

To install the latest version, run:
sudo dnf install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
If prompted to accept the GPG key, verify that the fingerprint matches 060A 61C5 1B55 8A7F 742B 77AA C52F EB6B 621E 9F35, and if so, accept it.

This command installs Docker, but it doesn't start Docker. It also creates a docker group, however, it doesn't add any users to the group by default.

Start Docker Engine.

sudo systemctl enable --now docker
This configures the Docker systemd service to start automatically when you boot your system. If you don't want Docker to start automatically, use sudo systemctl start docker instead.

To install a specific version, start by listing the available versions in the repository:


 dnf list docker-ce --showduplicates | sort -r

docker-ce.x86_64    3:28.1.1-1.el9    docker-ce-stable
docker-ce.x86_64    3:28.1.0-1.el9    docker-ce-stable
<...>
The list returned depends on which repositories are enabled, and is specific to your version of RHEL (indicated by the .el9 suffix in this example).

Install a specific version by its fully qualified package name, which is the package name (docker-ce) plus the version string (2nd column), separated by a hyphen (-). For example, docker-ce-3:28.1.1-1.el9.

Replace <VERSION_STRING> with the desired version and then run the following command to install:


 sudo dnf install docker-ce-VERSION_STRING docker-ce-cli-VERSION_STRING containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
This command installs Docker, but it doesn't start Docker. It also creates a docker group, however, it doesn't add any users to the group by default.
